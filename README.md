# scatter-calc
## atomic and molecular collisional cross section generator
### Using several different scattering calculation methods, this project aims to provide accurate collisional cross sections for use in external applications or simulations.
### Initial version desired functionality:
* Recreate functionality of fortran-collide (in this repo), which uses ab-initio interaction potentials and partial wave methods to calculate accurate quantum mechanical cross sections
  * See: http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/756/1/57
* Add feature to save cross sections to a MongoDB database with "smart" data schema for use by other applications in the future
